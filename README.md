# template_webapp
My template for my webapp. I use Python in Backend + Vue.js in Frontend.

# Try the project

## Using Webapp

### 1. Install Docker

To run the project, you'll first need to install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) on your computer.

### 2. Install Make (Optional)

The project use a Makefile to run the docker and avoid you to type manually the command. You can follow this [link](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/#download) to install `make` or search by yourself. But is optional.

### 2. Run the webapp
#### With Make
Run this command in your terminal :
```
make
```
Will display this :
