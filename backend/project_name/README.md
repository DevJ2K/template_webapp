## Description

A brief description of the project goes here. Explain the purpose, goals, and key features of the project in a concise manner. This could be a tool, a script, or an application, and this section should provide enough context to understand its utility.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.9 or newer installed. You can download the latest version of Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

### Setup

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DevJ2K/template_webapp.git
    cd template_webapp/backend/project_name
    ```

2. **(Optional) Create a Virtual Environment:**

    It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**

    If there are any dependencies, you should list them in a `requirements.txt` file. Install them using:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

### Running the Script

You can run the script in one of the following ways:

1. **Make the script executable:**

    ```bash
    chmod +x main.py
    ```

    Then execute it directly:

    ```bash
    ./main.py
    ```

2. **Using the Python command:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    Or

    ```bash
    python3 main.py
    ```

### Expected Output

Once the script is run successfully, you should see the following output:

```
It's work !
```
